In this project, an e-commerce store provided me with data of their sales transactions, and asked me to generate a cross-selling report by categorizing the sales based on product 
combinations. We meticulously analyzed the sales data,extracted category codes, and grouped the information by month, ultimately identifying the top 13 most frequently sold item combinations.
This comprehensive analysis offers valuable insights into customer preferences and popular product pairings, enabling the e-commerce store to optimize their marketing strategies and enhance
the overall shopping experience. 


Problem statements : 
let us walk you through some definitions,
Parent product: Those SKUs which don’t describe any variations.
For ex: Barbell-1, Ball-2, Ring-94, Care-Disc, etc.


Child product: Those SKUs which display coded variations in terms of material, size, stone color, etc.
For ex: Nose-177-GD-3 & Nose-177-K-3. They belong to the parent product Nose-177.




Objective - Analyse the provided sample data to determine which products are commonly sold together, generating a Cross-Selling Report.
The report should showcase the ranking of product pairs, ranging from 1 to 13. For example:






The list should go on for each Parent Product.

Data tables - You shall find two tables,
Sales Data: Contains all relevant sales data. For this report, focus solely on the 'Document No' and 'Item No' columns. The sales amount is excluded for simplicity.
Item Categories: The column ‘No.’ contains child product level, while ‘Item Category Code’ contains parent products.

Timeframe - The provided data covers sales information for three months. Your report should display results for each individual month and a consolidated view 
for the entire three-month period.

Efficiency Considerations - The report's processing speed is crucial. Avoid using Nested IFS if possible, as they may slow down the report.
Opt for logical methods that enhance performance. If there are alternative logical approaches to achieve the same result without compromising speed, incorporate them.
